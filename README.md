## GPS-Router üó∫Ô∏è
GPS Router is a Java ‚òï program which imports nodes' information from external sources (JSON file in this case)
and computes the best possible route from one point to the other  using 3Ô∏è‚É£ possible, well-known algorithms to choose from.
The program is implementable in other projects. It uses two distance-counting methods:
- Euclidian
- Geographical (more effective when nodes are far away from each other)

The project shows route's total distance.

Worth mentioning is a fact, that edges' (connections') directions are considerated, so nodes can be connected either one-way or 
two-way.
